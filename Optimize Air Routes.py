# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach: This code finds all pairs of routes (one from forward, one from backward) whose combined distance is as close as possible to target without exceeding it. It sorts the backward array, then for each forward route, uses binary search to find the best possible backward route that keeps the sum â‰¤ target. The result collects all such optimal pairs that achieve the maximum feasible sum.
